This is a tic-tac-toe web application that allows users to play both standard
tic-tac-toe and a new variant of tic-tac-toe called Tactico, which allows your
opponent to block your moves.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, Javascript

In building this application, I first made sure I could make the appropriate
requests to the pre-built API. I then planned out the features I wanted in the
application, keeping in mind the format of the API requests. I tried to take
small, incremental steps throughout the process, which was helpful in some
regards, and slightly detrimental in others.

The main thing I want to change on this project is refactoring. I know this is
very messy right now. Part of that was not quite enough planning in the
beginning, part of that was the incremental design process, and part of that was
a time crunch. I will reorganize a lot of this code, but it is functional right
in its current state. I probably could have implemented the multi-device
function, but I don't want to until I have the ability to change the back-end.
The tactico game mode would not be available through multi-device without those
changes to the back-end. I also need to make the application a bit more
responsive.
